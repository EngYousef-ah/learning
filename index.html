		by  choosing the starting letter in each word, 
		with the letter that you chose.</p>

   <h2 style="padding-left:30px ;">Letter Combinations and Digraphs in English Alphabet Pronunciation :</h2>
   <p class="content">The are 5 vowels and 21 consonants among English alphabet letters.
	 However, each letter can be pronounced in a few different ways,
	  creating over 40 distinct sounds. There are various combinations
	   and sequences of English letters and sounds. </p>
   <h3>Consonant Clusters and Digraphs</h3>
   <p class="content">Consonant clusters are sequences of two or more consonant
	 sounds that appear together in a word without any vowel
	  sounds between them. They can occur at a word’s beginning,
	   middle, or end. Let’s look at some common examples:</p>
	   <ul class="ul">
		<li>at the beginning: straight, splash, strong, three, scratch, spread, sphere;</li>
		<li>in the middle: instrument, inscribe, wrestle, monster, promptly, catcher, helpless;</li>
		<li>at the end: world, tempt, lunch, months, first, bursts, script.</li>
	   </ul>
	
	<p class="content">Some of the consonant clusters often create
		 digraphs – combinations of two letters that 
		 create a single sound. 
	</p>
	<ul class="ul"> 
		<li>ch -  cheese, chair, church, charm.</li>
		<li>sh -  ship, sheet, shape, shoe.</li>
		<li>th -  (pronuonced like “s” with a tongue between teeth) – thin, teeth, health, thanks.</li>
		<li>th -  (pronounced like “z” with a tongue between teeth) - these, although, that,</li>
		<li>ph -  phone, photo, philosophy, pharmacy. </li>
	</ul>
	<p class="content">It’s important to note that the pronunciation of consonant 
		clusters can vary in different languages and dialects. These 
		examples represent common patterns in the English alphabet, but 
		other tongues may have different digraphs or consonant clusters.
	</p>
	<h3>Vowel Combinations	</h3>
	<p class="content">Just like consonants, vowels also 
		produce plenty of sounds. Combining 
		two of the same letters can create entirely
		 different pronunciations. Look at these examples:
	</p>
	<ul class="ul">
		<li>ea –  “seat” or “beat,  “bread” or “dead.”</li>
		<li>ie –  “pie” or “tie,  “yield” or “believe.”</li>
		<li>ou –  “house” or “mouse”,  “through” or “trough.”</li>
		<li>ei –  “vein”,  “height.”</li>
		<li>oo –  “pool” or “school”,   “good” or “book.”</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="content">These are only a few vowel combinations, but there are many more.
		 It is also important to note that the pronunciation of the same
		  vowel sounds may differ in some English accents.
	</p>
	<h3>Silent Letters	</h3>
	<p class="content">English language might be challenging for many language-learners. 
		Sometimes, when you write the word down, it has more letters 
		than when you pronounce it. That’s because of the silent letters – the ones
		 that are present in the written version of the term but are omitted when said
		  out loud. Almost every vowel and consonant in the English alphabet can be silent.
	 </p>
	 <ul class="ul">
		<li>b – thumb , comb , lamb </li>
		<li>c – muscle </li>
		<li>d – Wednesday </li>
		<li>e – come  give </li>
		<li>g – gnaw , sign , reign </li>
		<li>h – honest , ghost</li>
		<li>k – knee , knife , know </li>
		<li>l – calf , salmon</li>
		<li>n – hymn , autumn</li>
		<li>p – pneumonia , psychology </li>
		<li>t – castle , ballet</li>
		<li>w – wraith , wrinkle </li>
		<li>x – faux</li>
	 </ul>
	 <p class="content">Tricky silent letters can appear anytime you learn the English alphabet.
		 Yet, they are still very important. Such letters help us distinguish
		  homophones (for example, night and knight) and provide the information
		   about the etymology and origins of particular words.
